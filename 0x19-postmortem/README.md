# Postmortem: Unintended Translations on Quran Reading Website

## Issue Summary
**Duration**: April 1, 2023, 9:00 AM - April 1, 2023, 12:00 PM (PST)  
**Impact**: A small Quran reading website experienced a translation issue, resulting in users encountering unexpected and inaccurate translations of Quranic verses. Approximately 80% of the users were affected by the incident, causing confusion and concern.

## Timeline
- **Issue Detected**: April 1, 2023, 9:00 AM (PST)
- **Issue Detection**: User reports flooded the website's support channels, highlighting the presence of strange and incorrect translations. The support team immediately investigated the issue upon receiving the reports.
- **Actions Taken**: The development team quickly identified the translation problem and started investigating the root cause to rectify the situation promptly.
- **Misleading Investigation**: Initially, the team suspected a data corruption issue or a misconfiguration in the translation database. They spent valuable time investigating these paths before realizing the actual cause of the problem.
- **Escalation**: As the investigation progressed, the incident was escalated to senior developers and language experts within the team to ensure a comprehensive analysis and resolution.
- **Incident Resolution**: After identifying the root cause as a bug in the translation algorithm, the development team worked diligently to fix the issue and restore accurate translations.

## Root Cause and Resolution
**Root Cause**: A bug in the translation algorithm caused the incorrect rendering of Quranic verses. The bug introduced inconsistencies and inaccuracies, leading to the unintended translations that users encountered.

**Resolution**: The development team addressed the bug by conducting a thorough code review and identifying the specific logic responsible for the incorrect translations. They implemented a fix to the algorithm and deployed an update to the website, ensuring that accurate translations were restored.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
1. Rigorous Testing: Enhance the testing process to include comprehensive checks for translation accuracy, ensuring that all Quranic verses are correctly rendered before deployment.
2. Version Control: Implement a version control system to track changes in the translation algorithm, allowing for easier identification and rollback of erroneous updates if needed.
3. Language Expert Involvement: Collaborate with language experts or scholars to verify translations and ensure their accuracy before integrating them into the system.
4. User Feedback Integration: Establish channels for users to provide feedback on translations, enabling prompt identification and resolution of any potential inaccuracies or inconsistencies.
5. Continuous Improvement: Conduct regular code reviews and periodic audits of the translation algorithm to identify and address any potential issues proactively.

## Conclusion
The translation issue on the Quran reading website resulted from a bug in the translation algorithm, leading to unintended and inaccurate renditions of Quranic verses. Through the prompt detection and diligent efforts of the development team, the root cause was identified and resolved. By implementing rigorous testing, involving language experts, and leveraging user feedback, the website aims to provide users with accurate and reliable Quranic translations. The team remains committed to maintaining the integrity and authenticity of the Quranic text, ensuring a meaningful experience for all users.
